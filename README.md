### ffmpeg UI

ffmpeg is a powerful tool for working with audio and video files, but its command-line interface can be intimidating and difficult to use for beginners. This project aims to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for ffmpeg that makes it easy for users to work with audio and video files without having to memorize complex command-line arguments.

The ffmpeg UI will provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their desired conversion settings, such as video and audio codecs, resolution, bitrate, and other options. Users will be able to browse and select their input files and preview their output files before conversion. The interface will also include options to adjust audio and video quality and add subtitles or watermarks to the output video.

The ffmpeg UI will be designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind, so it can be used on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. The application will be open-source and free to use, allowing users to easily download and install the software from the project's website or GitHub repository.

The goal of this project is to make ffmpeg accessible to a wider range of users by providing a simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to take advantage of ffmpeg's powerful capabilities without requiring them to learn complex command-line arguments.
